## How it Works
Frontend: React for the web application, which provides a responsive and interactive user interface. Material-UI is integrated to ensure a consistent and sleek design across the app.

Backend: The backend is powered by Node.js, handling the API requests. I also integrated a Flask server for specific tasks related to the machine learning model.

Database: Supabase is utilized for the database needs, leveraging PostgreSQL for efficient data storage and retrieval. It also manages user authentication securely.

Machine Learning: I've developed a custom matchmaking algorithm using various machine learning techniques, including neural networks, to pair dogs based on compatibility. This involves data processing, model training, and continuous optimization.

APIs: The Position Stack API is used to geocode user addresses and calculate distances for match recommendations. ImgBB is used for hosting user-uploaded images, ensuring smooth image handling.
